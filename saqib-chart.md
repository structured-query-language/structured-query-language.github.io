# Saqib Chart
A Saqib Chart is used to visually analyze the cumulative trend over a period of time. It does this by charting out the Number of Consecutive Increases (positive) and Consecutive Descreases (negative) bar chart lines. It is particularly useful in analyzing Stocks. It can also be used to check if Seasonality exists in a Time-series data.
