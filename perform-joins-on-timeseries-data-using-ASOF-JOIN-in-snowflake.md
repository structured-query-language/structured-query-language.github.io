# Perform joins on timeseries data using ASOF JOIN in Snowflake

Combining two or more tables using values from a related column is one of the most common tasks when analyzing data. This is typically done by matching the values in the related column(s).

But this runs into problems because real world data often does NOT yield perfect matches.

This is particularly true when dealing with streaming data. For instance, imagine that you have two tables. A `stock_portfolio` table showing the time at which different trades for a particular stock were executed and another with the `stock_prices`. Both these tables are recorded with a timestamp with millisecond intervals.
