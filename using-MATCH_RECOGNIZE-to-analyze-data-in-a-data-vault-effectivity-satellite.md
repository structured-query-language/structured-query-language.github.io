# MATCH_RECOGNIZE and Data Vault Effectivity Satellite
[Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) is a powerful Data Vault artifact that is used to track the effectivity of a relationship. For e.g. it can be used to track the relationship between:
1. Order and Customer, or 
2. Opportunity and Account, or 
3. Subscription Tier and Customer etc. 

> A Data Vault [Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) hangs from the LINK, and only contains the **Driving Business Key**, **Secondary Foreign Key** and the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the given Relationship.


## Example of an Effectitity Satellite

| CUSTOMER_BK | SUBSCRIPTION_TIER_BK | START_DATE | END_DATE   |
|-------------|----------------------|------------|------------|
| Scott       | Personal             | 2021-01-01 | 9999-12-31 |
| Scott       | Personal             | 2021-01-01 | 2021-06-01 |
| Scott       | Free                 | 2021-06-01 | 9999-12-31 |
| Bob         | Business             | 2021-02-01 | 9999-12-31 |
| Angela      | Premium              | 2021-02-01 | 9999-12-31 |
| Angela      | Premium              | 2021-02-01 | 2021-03-01 |
| Angela      | Free                 | 2021-03-01 | 9999-12-31 |
| Ryan        | Free                 | 2021-03-01 | 9999-12-31 |

The above [Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) is used to track the subscription tier a Customer has purchased. The `CUSTOMER_BK` is the Driving Key, and the `SUBSCRIPTION_TIER_BK` is the Secondary Foreign Key. The `START_DATE` and the `END_DATE` indicate when the Subscription was purchased and when it was ended. 

> **Note:** Since Data Vault 2.0 is an insert only pattern, we do not update the existing record to set the `END_DATE`, instead we insert a new record with the `END_DATE` set.

# Effecivity Satellite and Data Analysis
The structure of an [Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) lends itself to Longitudinal Data Analysis. You can identify patterns, perform timeseries analysis or even use the data directly in statistical learning model. 

## MATCH_RECOGNIZE and pattern recognition

In relational systems, a row pattern recognition task is to detect a sequence of ordered rows from an input table that match a specified pattern. For example, a financial service provider needs to identify sequences of suspicious transactions that match known patterns of criminal activities; an e-commerce site analyzes the steps taken by customers from landing through a social media referrer to a successful purchase.

One way to analyze data in an [Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) is to use SQL's pattern matching capability i.e. the [MATCH_RECOGNIZE](applied-overview-of-MATCH_RECOGNIZE-clause.md) clause.

[MATCH_RECOGNIZE](applied-overview-of-MATCH_RECOGNIZE-clause.md) clause in a SQL Query allows us to:
1. Define patterns using REGEX convention
2. Match longitudinal data against those patterns
3. Identify records that match the patterns

The following [MATCH_RECOGNIZE](applied-overview-of-MATCH_RECOGNIZE-clause.md) query can be used on the above [Effectivity Satellite](data-vault-effectivity-satellite.md) to identity Customer that switched from a PAID Wordpress tier to FREE tier. 

```sql
select * 
from sate_customer_subscription
match_recognize(
  partition by customer_bk
  order by start_date
  measures
    paid.subscription_tier_bk as paid_subscription_tier
    , paid.start_date paid_subscription_start_date
    , free.start_date basic_susbcription_start_date   
  after match skip past last row
  pattern (paid+ free)
  define 
    paid as paid.subscription_tier_bk in ('Personal', 'Premium', 'Business'), 
    free as free.subscription_tier_bk = 'Free'
)
```

There are three tiers of PAID plans-- Personal, Premium and Business. A Customer may switch between these tiers multiple times before finally downgrading to a FREE tier.


### Query Output

The query identified the following Customers that had PAID subscription and then eventually downgraded to a FREE tier

| CUSTOMER_BK | PAID_SUBSCRIPTION_TIER | PAID_SUBSCRIPTION_START_DATE | BASIC_SUSBCRIPTION_START_DATE |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Scott       | Personal               | 2021-01-01                   | 2021-06-01                    |
| Angela      | Premium                | 2021-02-01                   | 2021-03-01                    |
