# ASOF and MATCH_CONDITION join in Snowflake

## What is an ASOF Join?

Time series data is not always perfectly aligned. Timestamps may be slightly off, or there may be a delay between cause and effect. This can make connecting two sets of ordered data challenging. ASOF joins are a tool for solving this and other similar problems.

One of the problems that ASOF joins are used to solve is finding the value of a varying property at a specific point in time. 

More generally, however, ASOF joins embody some common temporal analytic semantics, which can be cumbersome and slow to implement in standard SQL.

## Stock Portfolio Example Data Set

Let’s start with a Stock Portofolio example. 

We have a table `stock_prices` of stock prices with timestamps:

### stock_prices

| SYMBOL | PRICE | STOCK_PRICE_ASOF        |
|--------|-------|-------------------------|
| TSLA   | 9.93  | 2024-02-02 14:29:10.753 |
| TSLA   | 9.62  | 2024-02-02 14:29:52.806 |
| TSLA   | 9.61  | 2024-02-02 14:30:43.379 |
| TSLA   | 9.93  | 2024-02-02 14:32:35.397 |
| TSLA   | 9.68  | 2024-02-02 14:41:38.263 |
| TSLA   | 9.05  | 2024-02-02 14:45:00.480 |
| TSLA   | 9.06  | 2024-02-02 14:45:32.556 |
| TSLA   | 9.88  | 2024-02-02 15:04:29.979 |
| TSLA   | 9.72  | 2024-02-02 15:06:40.404 |
| TSLA   | 9.44  | 2024-02-02 15:23:07.893 |
| TSLA   | 9.13  | 2024-02-02 15:23:21.083 |

We have another table `stock_portfolio` containing portfolio holdings at various points in time:

### stock_portfolio

| SYMBOL | NUMBER_OF_SHARES | TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP   |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| TSLA   | 100.00           | 2024-02-02 14:29:20.264 |
| TSLA   | 77.00            | 2024-02-02 14:30:51.040 |
| TSLA   | 56.00            | 2024-02-02 14:45:41.192 |
| TSLA   | 86.00            | 2024-02-02 15:06:48.475 |
| TSLA   | 60.00            | 2024-02-02 15:23:12.587 |

> Note that the `transaction_timestamp` from `stock_portfolio` does not align with the `stock_price_asof` in the `stock_prices` table.

## ASOF Joins in Snowflake

We can compute the value of each holding at that point in time by finding the most recent price before the holding’s timestamp by using an AsOf Join.

### SQL Query

```sql
select 
  stock_portfolio.symbol
  , price as stock_price
  , number_of_shares
  , transaction_timestamp
  , stock_price_asof  
  , price * number_of_shares as value
from stock_portfolio
asof join stock_prices
  match_condition (stock_portfolio.transaction_timestamp >= stock_prices.stock_price_asof)
  on stock_prices.symbol = stock_portfolio.symbol ;
```

This attaches the value of the holding at that time to each row.

### Query Output

| SYMBOL | STOCK_PRICE | NUMBER_OF_SHARES | TRANSACTION_TIMESTAMP   | STOCK_PRICE_ASOF        | VALUE    |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| TSLA   | 9.93        | 100.00           | 2024-02-02 14:29:20.264 | 2024-02-02 14:29:10.753 | 993.0000 |
| TSLA   | 9.61        | 77.00            | 2024-02-02 14:30:51.040 | 2024-02-02 14:30:43.379 | 739.9700 |
| TSLA   | 9.06        | 56.00            | 2024-02-02 14:45:41.192 | 2024-02-02 14:45:32.556 | 507.3600 |
| TSLA   | 9.72        | 86.00            | 2024-02-02 15:06:48.475 | 2024-02-02 15:06:40.404 | 835.9200 |
| TSLA   | 9.44        | 60.00            | 2024-02-02 15:23:12.587 | 2024-02-02 15:23:07.893 | 566.4000 |


It essentially executes a function defined by looking up nearby values in the `stock_prices` table. 

## Windowing Alternative

Standard SQL can implement this kind of join, but you need to use an `effectivity` table using a windowing function as following:

```sql
with stock_price_effectivity as (
  select 
    symbol
    , stock_price_asof as start_time
    , lead (stock_price_asof) over (partition by symbol order by start_time asc) as end_time 
    , price
  from stock_prices
)   

select 
  stock_portfolio.symbol
  , price
  , number_of_shares * price as value from state
inner join stock_portfolio
on state.symbol = stock_portfolio.symbol
  and stock_portfolio.transaction_timestamp between start_time and end_time;
```

> Note that we are first calculating the `effectivity` or `state` of stock price at each of the interval using the `stock_price_asof` timestamp. This is an expensive operation.


Here what the output of the `stock_price_effectivity` will look like:


| SYMBOL | START_TIME              | END_TIME                | PRICE |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| TSLA   | 2024-02-02 14:29:10.753 | 2024-02-02 14:29:52.806 | 9.93  |
